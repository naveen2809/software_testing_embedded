LED Driver Requirements:
1. The LED Driver controls 16 two state LEDs (On/Off)
2. The driver can turn on of off individual LEDs without affecting others
3. The driver can turn on or off all LEDs at once using a single interface call
4. The user of the driver can query the state of any LED
5. At power on, the hardware default is for the LEDs to be latched on. They must me turned off by the software
6. The LEDs are memory mapped to a 16-bit word
7. A 1 in a bit position turns on the LEDs and a 0 turns it off
8. The least significant bit corresponds to LED 1 and the most significant bit corresponds to LED 16

Test Cases:
1. Check that the LED driver's initialization function turns off all the LEDs
2. Check that the LED driver can correctly turn on all LEDs when the corresponding LED is off
    - Turn on LED 1, Turn on LED2, ...., Turn on LED 16
3. Check that the LED driver can correctly turn on all LEDs when the corresponding LED is on
    - Turn on LED 1, Turn on LED2, ...., Turn on LED 16
3. Check that the LED driver can correctly turn off all LEDs when the corresponding LED is on
    - Turn off LED 1, Turn off LED2, ...., Turn off LED 16
3. Check that the LED driver can correctly turn off all LEDs when the corresponding LED is off
    - Turn off LED 1, Turn off LED2, ...., Turn off LED 16
4. Check that the LED driver can turn on all LEDs correctly
    - Right After intialialization
    - After some LEDs are turned on
    - After turning off all LEDs
5. Check that the LED driver can turn off all the LEDs correctly
    - Right after initialization
    - After all LEDs are turned on
    - After some LEDs are turned on
6. Check that the LED driver can correctly read the status of an LED that is on when only that LED is on
    - Read LED 1 (On), Read LED2 (On), ...., Read LED 16 (On)
7. Check that the LED driver can correctly read the status of an LED that is off when only that LED is off
    - - Read LED 1 (Off), Read LED2 (Off), ...., Read LED 16 (Off)
8. Check that all the LEDs are turned on initially (can only be checked on the Target Hardware)
